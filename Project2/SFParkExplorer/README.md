Project 2 - SFParkExplorer App

What it does:
The purpose of the app is allow the user to explore an existing set of parks based on three criteria: size (acres), busyness and cleanliness (both on a score of 0 to 10). The user can ultimately see the details page for each park where its information is displayed. On the same details page the user is given the ability to add or remove a park from a My Favorites list. That list is made available to the user by accessing it from the home screen.

Known bugs:
1) If a park is already in My Favorites the toast will still say "Park added to My Favorites".
2) Some of the components in the XML layouts don't scale properly when the device changes orientation from portait to landscape.
3) The Details screen does not display the data for Marina Green properly, it cuts off a TextView.
