Project 2 - SFParkExplorer App

What it does:
The purpose of the app is allow the user to explore an existing set of parks based on three criteria: size (acres), busyness and cleanliness (both on a score of 0 to 10). The user can ultimately see the details page for each park where its information is displayed. On the same details page the user is given the ability to add or remove a park from a My Favorites list. That list is made available to the user by accessing it from the home screen.

Known bugs:
1) The details layout may mis-display the buttons if the screen is rotated to landscape or if the device used has a screen that varies from a Nexus 7.
